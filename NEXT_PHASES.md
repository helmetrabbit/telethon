# Remaining Execution Plan

We have completed the project in 3 final phases.

## Phase 4: Advanced Inference Architecture (v0.6.0)
**Focus**: "Fake Green" items (Multi-label & Temporal).
- [x] **Temporal Weighting**: Refactor scoring to decay older evidence.
- [x] **Multi-label Roles**: Unlock the engine to emit multiple roles.

## Phase 5: Observability & Tools
**Focus**: Dashboard & Missing Tools.
- [x] **Coverage Dashboard**: Created `src/cli/analyze-results.ts`.
- [x] **Near-Miss Analysis**: Tool reports "near miss" users.

## Phase 6: Production Hardening
**Focus**: Final Polish.
- [x] **Cross-Validation**: Verified via `verify-decay.ts`.
- [x] **Documentation**: See `FINAL_REPORT.md`.
